## Percentage
- Units of solute per 100 units of solution
- If units are not specified, % is to be read as w**/v**
- **Weight per volume (w/v)**
	- A 1% solution w/v contains **1 g** of solute in **100 ml <u>total</u> volume** of solution
- **Weight per weight (w/w)**
	- A 1% solution w/w contains **1 g** of solute in **100 g <u>total</u> weight** of solution
	- I.e., 1 g of solute + 99 g of solvent
- **Volume per volume (v/v)**
	- A 1% v/v solution of ethanol in water would be **1 ml** ethanol + **99 ml** water 
## Molarity
- Number of **moles** of solute **per litre** of solution.
- 1 mole = $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ particles (**Avogadro's constant**)
- $\text{moles} = M\times V$
	- $M$ is the **molar concentration** of the solution
	- $V$ is the volume in **litres**
- The mass of **1 mole** of any solute is equal to its **formula weight** in grams
- $\text{moles = mass (in grams)} \div \text{formula weight}$ 
	- Formula weight is the **sum of the atomic weights** of all elements in the substance
## Osmolarity (OsM)
- The **sum of the molar concentrations** of all the solute particles in solution
- OsM = molarity $\times$ number of particles the solute dissociates to
- Ignores the fact that the **effective concentration** is **reduced** by **interactions** between solute particles
	- Good **approximation** for **dilute** solutions
- E.g., the osmolarity of a 1 M NaCl solution is 2 OsM
	- In solution, 1 mole of NaCl **dissociates** â†’ 1 mole Na<sup>+</sup> + 1 mole Cl<sup>-</sup>
